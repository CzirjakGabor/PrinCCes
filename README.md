# PrinCCes
PrinCCes: continuity-based geometric decomposition and systematic visualization of the void repertoire of proteins

GUI (Graphical User Interface) versions are recommended for most users.
 MS Windows: Extract the msi package from the ZIP file and double-click to auto-install.
 Linux systems: Extract the files from the TAR.GZ archive to an empty directory. See the README file for installation.
 
Command line versions are for batch operations, scripting and software development.
 Extract the files to an empty directory. See the README file for installation. Type “princ -h” for help.
 
VMD or Chimera software is required for the visualization of the results. 
 Please, download one (or both) of them, if they are not available on your system.

All packages include executable and source code. 
 The source code may be platform-dependent, especially between the Windows and Linux GUI versions. 
 The source codes of the Linux GUI versions could be attempted to be compiled by the FPC/Lazarus IDE on Windows, 
   but not the other way around.
